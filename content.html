<h2>Concept</h2>

<p>The Atomic Learning Platform is different from traditional learning management systems in that it is designed to deliver very short, focused pages of content that can be completed in a few minutes. Each piece of content describes which other pieces of content should be completed before it (prerequisites). The definition of these prerequisites allows the platform to sequence content for each learner into a queue of content that they should complete next.</p>

<p>This means that an individual piece of content may be viewed by learners as part of very different learning paths, depending on their goals. For instance, a page about the quadratic equation might be viewed by one learner who is a physicist on a learning path about ballistic motion, or a business student on a path about profit optimization. The page is relevant to both of their learning journeys, but they will experience it with a different end goal. This allows material to be communally pooled and reused across different learning paths. However, it does lead to some considerations about how to organise and sequence the content on the platform:</p>
